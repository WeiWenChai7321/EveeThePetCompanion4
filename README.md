## Context
Pet monitoring cameras have traditionally been limited in features, typically functioning as static cameras with the occasional capability to dispense treats or utilize a laser pointer. However, more sophisticated solutions are required to allow pet owners to remotely engage with their pets in a way that is indistinguishable from doing so at the owner's own house. This lets pet owners interact with their pets whenever they want, whether they're away at work, on vacation, or just relaxing at home.

In order to meet this need, we have designed a cutting-edge pet monitoring robot with many advantages over traditional pet monitors. Our robot features a treat dispenser that can be operated from afar via a mobile app and a live video feed that pet owners may watch whenever they choose. Moreover, our robot possesses the ability to navigate through the home, follow predetermined paths, avoid obstacles, detect gas, and dispense treats.

## Key Features
The Pet Monitoring Robot offers the following key features:

1. **Live Video Streaming**: Owners can remotely access a real-time video stream of their pets, allowing them to observe their behavior and activities.

2. **Remote Treat Dispenser**: Evee incorporates a treat dispenser that can be controlled through a dedicated application. This feature enables owners to remotely reward their pets with a single pellet, enhancing their ability to interact with and train their pets from a distance. There is also a touch sensor for the pet to trigger the treat dispenser.

3. **Remote Control Movement**: Unlike conventional pet monitors, our product can be remotely controlled to move around the home. This functionality enables owners to actively engage with their pets and participate in activities such as playing and exercising, even when they are not physically present.

4. **Line Following and Obstacle Avoidance**: Equipped with advanced navigation capabilities, the robot can follow predetermined lines and intelligently navigate around obstacles. This ensures that the robot can move freely and safely throughout the home environment.

## Conclusion
To summarize, we hope that Evee the Pet Companion will be a practical solution that will address the limitations of traditional pet monitoring cameras. Pet owners can rely on Evee to bridge the gap and ensure a fulfilling and interactive experience for both pets and owners alike.
